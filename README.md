# Sysadmin Badge

This is the PCB design for the Sysadmin badge.

The LCD being used is a standard 1.3" 240x240 display from Ali Express. Searching `1.3 inch IPS display TFT LCD 1.3" Display Screen Module 240*240 ST7789 Drive IC SPI HD Full Color for IPS Display Module 240X240` and selecting the "welded" or "soldered" variety will yield the correct board. 

The soldered-on cable was chosen for cost reduction.
