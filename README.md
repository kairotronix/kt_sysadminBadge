# SysAdmin Badge

This is the PCB design for the SysAdmin Day badge.

The badge design is inspired by deep thought, from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The LCD being used is a standard 1.3" 240x240 display from Ali Express. Searching `1.3 inch IPS display TFT LCD 1.3" Display Screen Module 240*240 ST7789 Drive IC SPI HD Full Color for IPS Display Module 240X240` and selecting the "welded" or "soldered" variety will yield the correct board. 

The soldered-on cable was chosen for cost reduction.

# What is the idea
In case of fire, a quick reaction is needed, but if you just woke up, if you are in the bathroom or in any compromising situation, the sysadmin must always respond to the user, and then fix the incident.

For this reason, we have designed a random excuse generator that will give you a perfect SLA, even in desperate moments.

## History
The System Administrator Appreciation Day, It is celebrated on the last Friday of July since the year 2000.

The holiday was started by a system administrator nicknamed Sleeping Beauty (AS). He got his inspiration from a Hewlett-Packard magazine ad, in which an administrator's co-workers gave him flowers and a fruit basket for setting up their new printers and a pillow to rest on in their spare time.

Wait… what exactly is SysAdmin Day? it’s only the single greatest 24 hours on the planet… and pretty much the most important holiday of the year. It’s also the perfect opportunity to pay tribute to the heroic men and women who, come rain or shine, prevent disasters, keep IT secure and put out tech fires left and right.

At this point, you may be thinking, “Great. I get it. My SysAdmin is a rock star. But now what?” Glad you asked! Proper observation of SysAdmin Day includes (but is not limited to):

Cake & Ice cream
